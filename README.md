# Sustainable Agriculture â€“ Smart Farming Support Project

This is a beginner-level personal project where I developed simple Python functions to support smart farming decisions.  
The goal is to help farmers make quick, logic-based decisions using basic weather and soil data.

## ðŸŒ± Features

### 1. Weather Analysis and Visualization
- Normalizes weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rain probability
- Uses `matplotlib` to graph and visualize normalized features
- Helps understand patterns and compare variables

### 2. Spraying Decision Function
- Determines whether it's safe to spray pesticide
- Checks conditions like temperature, wind speed, humidity, and chance of rain
- Returns messages like `"Spray: Weather is okay"` or `"No Spray: Wind too strong"`

### 3. Soil Condition Checker
- Analyzes soil pH, moisture, and nutrient levels (N, P, K)
- Gives recommendations like `"Check acidity"`, `"Irrigation needed"`, or `"Low Nitrogen"`

### 4. Irrigation Recommendation
- Suggests irrigation based on crop type and soil moisture level
- Supports crops like wheat, corn, and others
- Helps reduce water waste and increase efficiency
